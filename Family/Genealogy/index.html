      <TD NOSAVE>The internet continues to bring the world closer together. 
        The goal of this web site is to publish information about our family so 
        we can we can feel a little closer to each other. Even the smallest 
        information is a valuable asset to our family. This web page offers us 
        an information gateway to each other so we can share this asset.&nbsp; 
        <P>The initial security on the page is controlled by an encoded 
        directory.&nbsp; You can set a Bookmark with your Web Browser so you can 
        easily find the page.&nbsp; Others should not stumble into our virtual 
        site due to the directory encoding. If we don't share the directory code 
        name with others, this basic security method should be adequate to 
        protect our privacy.&nbsp; 
        <P>We are in our infancy, so this page will constantly change. Your 
        comments and suggestions are welcome and desired.&nbsp; <A 
        href="mailto:wps@CometDesign.com">Please send us pictures and 
        information about interests, hobbies, vocations, etc. to keep this page 
        updated.</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do not find a picture or information 
        about someone, it means we do not have photos or information (or can't 
        find it) and would enjoy having help in filling in the missing 
        pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We found many more group photos than 
        individual pictures.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do not find an individual photo, 
        please check the group photo page.&nbsp;

        you may find.</A></FONT>&nbsp; The changes are easy to make.&nbsp; We 
        want you to help us make this page as accurate as possible. We do not 
        mind any requests for removal or submittals of photos.&nbsp;&nbsp; Send 
        us pictures, information, comments, and changes via the email icon below

        <P>It has been very interesting for us to reminisce as we review some of 
        the family history and the genealogies that we have.&nbsp; We look 
        forward to keeping the page going with your help.&nbsp; Future ideas for 
        the page may include a chat room, and of course more information about 
        people including cousins and more ancestry.&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope you 
        spend some time here and enjoy.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>&nbsp;</UL>
